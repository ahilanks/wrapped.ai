Scraping and analyzing data from a chatbot leaderboard, including performance metrics like \"P95 First Chunk (s)\", \"TOTAL Response (s)\", and \"REASONING Time (s)\". You've shared CSV files and visualizations related to this work.\n\n2. Optimizing the asynchronous execution of your chatbot model queries, using Python's `asyncio.gather()` to run the queries concurrently. You were analyzing why the total execution time was longer than expected compared to the individual response times.\n\n3. Visualizing a speech transcript with applause markers, where you created a timeline-based React visualization to display the text and applause events.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have direct access to the details of your \"Tensor support in dump\" work that was mentioned in the current conversation. Could you please provide some more context about what you're working on related to tensor support? I'd be happy to assist further once I have a better understanding of the specific problem you're trying to solve."
