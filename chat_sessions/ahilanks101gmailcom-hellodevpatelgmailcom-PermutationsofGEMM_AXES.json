    "text": "Hello hello.devpatel@gmail.com, thanks for bringing up the topic of matrix multiplication. As an AI assistant, I'd be happy to provide some insights on the permutations of GEMM_AXES (General Matrix Multiplication Axes).\n\nMatrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra with many applications in machine learning, computer graphics, and scientific computing. The GEMM_AXES refer to the different ways the input matrices can be oriented for the multiplication operation.\n\nThe standard GEMM operation is defined as:\n\nC = alpha * A * B + beta * C\n\nWhere:\n- A is an m x k matrix\n- B is a k x n matrix \n- C is an m x n matrix\n- alpha and beta are scalar values\n\nThe GEMM_AXES refer to the different orientations the input matrices A and B can have. The most common permutations are:\n\n1. **NN (No Transpose)**: A is m x k, B is k x n\n2. **NT (A Transposed)**: A is k x m, B is k x n \n3. **TN (B Transposed)**: A is m x k, B is n x k\n4. **TT (Both Transposed)**: A is k x m, B is n x k\n\nThe choice of GEMM_AXES depends on how the input matrices are stored and accessed in memory. Certain permutations may be more efficient than others depending on the hardware, data layout, and other factors.\n\nFor example, the NN permutation is often the most efficient on modern CPUs and GPUs due to the contiguous memory access patterns. The other permutations may require additional matrix transposition steps, which can add overhead.\n\nUnderstanding the GEMM_AXES and their implications is important when optimizing matrix multiplication performance, especially in high-performance computing and deep learning applications. Let me know if you have any other questions!"
